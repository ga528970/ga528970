Imagine being a very wealthy businessman. They must be living the best life possible. Jeff is one of those people. He wakes up every morning right at 5am. Jeff does not need an alarm clock, he just gets out of bed unlike some people. Afterwards, Jeff brushes his teeth for exactly 2 minutes to keep his teeth pearly white. To keep in shape, he works out for 30 minutes. Today is arm day. Next, he showers and puts on his best suit that is custom-tailored to his height and length. By 6:30am he works on his start-up called, ‘Tech Savvy’ where they help people how to use the internet. It’s 7am and Jeff leaves home to start his day in the world.
